# Some personal info

## Despite nobody cares

I hope to be able to keep learning **UNIX-like operating** systems
so I can enhance my career. Currently I'm struggling to get a job,
which makes me feel really bad an underrated. *I hope this situation to be temporary*.

My preferences are:

- Embedded systems design
- Python programming
- Computer Architecture
- Computer Organization
- Data Science
- IT Automation

I would like to have the oportunity to get a Master Degree, but due to my economic
situation `I can't have acces to higher level education`.


```
I'm  unemployed.
I don't have acces to higher level education
Feels really bad.
But there is some hope, I think so...
